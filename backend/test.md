Input Code:
```javascript
function(){return a+b;}
```

Mistakes:
* 🐞 Missing function name. Anonymous functions require context (e.g., assignment to a variable).
* 🐞 `a` and `b` are undefined.

Improvements:
* ✨ Add a function name for clarity and reusability.
* ✨ Define parameters for the function to accept input.

Rating: ⭐ 4/10. Functionality is present, but it's missing crucial elements for proper use and context.

Improved Code:
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```
