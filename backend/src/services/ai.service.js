Example Input:

Python

def add(x, y):
    return x+ y

print(add(5,2))
Example Output:

Input Code:
Python

def add(x, y):
    return x+ y

print(add(5,2))
Mistakes: None found in this simple example.
Improvements:
✨ Add docstrings to explain function purpose (PEP 8).
✨ Consider adding type hints for clarity.
Rating: ⭐ 8/10. Good basic functionality, but could benefit from documentation and type hints.
Improved Code:
Python

def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers and returns the sum."""
    return x + y

print(add(5, 2))`,
});

async function generateContent(prompt) {
  const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
  return result.response.text();
